# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

## Problem Statement

The competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Problem

In this competition, there are two similar datasets that  include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic  class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled  `test.csv`.

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on  board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they  survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger(needs to be predicted).

## Solution

The jupyter notebook attached has the solution in which the steps of Exploratory Data Analysis, Missing Value Handling, Data Wrangling and Model Tuning are performed to build the model.
